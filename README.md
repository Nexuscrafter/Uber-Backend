# üöó Uber Backend System

### **Overview**  
This project is a backend system for an Uber-like ride-hailing application built using **Spring Boot** and designed with a **microservices architecture**. It ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient real-time processing to manage critical functionalities like user authentication, ride booking, driver tracking, and notifications.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack  
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Caching**: Redis  
- **Messaging**: Kafka  
- **Real-Time Communication**: STOMP over WebSockets  
- **Authentication**: JWT  
- **Tools**: Gradle, Eureka Service Discovery, Flyway  

---

## üöÄ Key Features  
### 1. **Microservices Architecture**  
- Divides functionalities into independent services for better scalability and fault isolation.  

#### Services:  
- **Booking Service**: Matches users with drivers and manages ride statuses.  
- **Auth Service**: Handles user registration, login, and authentication.  
- **Driver Location Service**: Tracks driver locations in real-time using Redis.  
- **Review Service**: Manages user reviews and ratings for drivers.  
- **Notification Service**: Sends real-time updates via WebSockets.  

---

### 2. **Secure Authentication with JWT**  
- Uses **Spring Security** for role-based access (driver, passenger).  
- Validates JWT tokens for each request, ensuring stateless authentication.  
- Ensures token expiration to enhance security.  

---

### 3. **Real-Time Driver Location Management**  
- **Redis**:  
  - Stores driver IDs and geospatial data for fast retrieval.  
  - Supports geospatial queries to find nearby drivers.  
- Optimized ride allocation with low-latency data retrieval.  

---

### 4. **Asynchronous Communication Between Services**  
- **Kafka** for interservice messaging:  
  - Booking Service emits ride requests.  
  - Notification Service consumes ride updates.  
- Ensures decoupled and fault-tolerant communication.  

---

### 5. **Real-Time Updates**  
- **STOMP over WebSockets**:  
  - Delivers real-time ride confirmations, driver arrival notifications, and ride completion updates.  
  - Secured WebSocket endpoints using JWT.  

---

### 6. **Database Management**  
- **Spring Data JPA** simplifies MySQL interactions for core entities like `Users`, `Rides`, `Drivers`, and `Reviews`.  
- **Flyway** handles database schema migrations seamlessly during deployment.  

---

### 7. **Service Discovery**  
- Configured **Eureka** for dynamic service registration and discovery.  
- Eliminates hardcoded endpoints, enabling dynamic scaling.

## üí° Challenges and Solutions  
| **Challenge**                | **Solution**                                                                                     |  
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Real-time driver location updates | Used Redis for fast geospatial queries and low-latency updates.                                 |  
| Scalability                  | Adopted microservices architecture and Kafka for distributed processing.                        |  
| Data consistency             | Leveraged Kafka for event-driven communication with idempotent message consumption.            |  
| Fault tolerance              | Utilized Kafka's message retention and Redis's in-memory persistence to ensure availability.    |

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Design Decisions  
1. **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services improve scalability and fault isolation.  
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Kafka ensures asynchronous, decoupled communication.  
3. **In-Memory Caching**: Redis optimizes read/write operations for real-time data.  
4. **WebSockets**: Enables instant notifications to improve user experience.

## üß≠ How to Run the Project  

### **Prerequisites**  
- Java 17  
- MySQL  
- Redis  
- Kafka  
- Gradle  

### **Steps**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository-url>  
   cd uber-backend  


### **Key API Endpoints**
## Auth Service
POST /register - Register a new user.
POST /login - Authenticate and retrieve a JWT.
# Booking Service
POST /request-ride - Request a ride.
Driver Location Service
POST /update-location - Update driver location.
GET /nearby-drivers - Retrieve nearby drivers based on a given location.
Notification Service
WebSocket /notifications - Subscribe to real-time updates.
üí° Advantages of Design
